				<h1>&lt; Cryptocurrency and Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs)&gt;</h1>
				<p>NFTs and Crypto have become increasingly relevant topic in recent years. Some see NFTs as part of the future with Crypto in creating a metaverse  but many also see NFTs as a thinly veiled attempt to: acquire revenue unethically, launder funds, encourage pump and dumps, and aid in rugpulls harming the consumer. <br><br> </p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>NFTs can be used for good. An example is 'Blazed Cats' which donates part of its proceeds to Mental Health America. This aid helps to support organizations helping others. However, NFTs are also often damaging to society preying on those who don't know much about NFTs and follow influencers (who get  paid to advertise the NFT) allowing the NFT creator and influencers to leave with a healthy profit but leave others with worthless 'unique' images. NFTs can also aid in creating a metaverse and are often connected with these projects but most of these projects are buzzwords and promises. In addition, NFTs are not required to create a metaverse.  </p>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>The economy implications of NFTs are where NFTs fall short. There is very little benefit aside from allowing artists to profit and sell their work. Unfortunately, more often art is stolen and sold as NFTs due to the secretive and anonymous nature of those who create NFTs. In addition, NFTs are being used to launder money and this occurence is rising as NFTs increase in popularity. Lastly, NFTs are often part of pump and dump schemes ensuring profit for the creator and early adopters but harming everyone else.</p>

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>NFTs by themselves do not have many political implications. However, in recent years parties are using NFTs to raise money by selling them in their campaign. This could help streamline fund raising and make it possible for more candidates to obtain funds promoting equality in politics. Functionally this replaces 'campaign buttons'... instead of a physical good you get a nonexistent virtual one that is 'unique'. In addition, NFTs could be used to circumvent some political campaign laws as they are harder to control and track. However, like Crypto Congress struggles to fully understand NFTs and if or how they would regulate them.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>In conclusion, while NFTs do promote many intriguing possibilities there is still much to be desired. There are possible benefits to NFTs as outlined above but at this moment NFTs are failing to provide a true positive impact instead being used unethically and in an unsavory manner. The future may help to elucidate the positives of NFTs with many projects working on incorporating NFTs but so far they are just empty buzzwords attracting investment without anything to show for it. As of now NFTs should be avoided and only approached with great care due to the  inherent risk of them- especially regarding speculative investment.</p>
